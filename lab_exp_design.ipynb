    "Blocking is the process in which we \"block\" the subjects in a given experiment which is where we put people who have things in common with each other first before we randomly assign the treatments and control groups within each set of \"blocks\". The reason why this is useful is that in bigger samples, random differences within the participants that may affect our data are typically evened out, but with smaller sample sizes, a \"small\" difference within the subjects could lead to misleading results. By first blocking, participants that have this common \"difference\" are separated from the other block and we collect data from each block which allows us to get quality data without any circumstances.
